A data management and reporting system for one of the projects I work with.
Allows users to import data to SQL server from custom Excel report formats.
Hope this will add greater reporting functions in future.
Designed to be as simple as possible and with as little maintenance effort as possible.
Do not expect much, but would appreciate your comments.
